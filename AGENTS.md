AGENTS

Stably’s agent specifications live in the /AGENTS directory.

Agents MUST read:

* /AGENTS/ROOT.md — the global agent specification
* Any additional protocol files in /AGENTS as they are added

All rules, workflows, constraints, and permissions for automated agents are defined exclusively inside the /AGENTS folder.
