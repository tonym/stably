# Long-term memory storage
# Organize as structured facts, decisions, or outputs agents may reuse

# ---
# NOTE ON SCALABILITY:
# This memory file is sufficient for current use but may require redesign as agents evolve.
#
# Potential scale concerns:
# - Large volumes of appended summaries or facts could slow parsing.
# - Lack of indexing may make retrieval inefficient for long-running sessions.
# - All agents currently share a flat memory structure â€” separation by role or topic may help.
#
# Future considerations:
# - Split memory into per-agent or per-topic files (e.g., memory/summarizer.yaml).
# - Move to a lightweight database or persistent key-value store.
# - Add timestamps and categories to entries for filtering or summarization.
#
# For now: keep structures simple, human-readable, and easy to version.
