This folder is used for agent prompt scaffolding and debugging.

## Structure
- `scaffolds/`: prompt format templates per role
- `generated/`: last emitted prompts (optional, for debug/log)

## Notes
Prompts are generated dynamically by agents using their contracts, memory, and context.
These files are not authoritative â€” they are for scaffolding, testing, or introspection.
